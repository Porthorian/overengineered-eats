From starting with the most prolific to to least prolific "movements".
Most prolific movements don't necessary mean "bad", just that you'll be back and forth quite a bit.
Least prolific movements mean consistency. You'll just go once or twice and be done.

- Cheap chinese food
- bbq / a lot of meats without veggies
- Split pea soup (this is a good cleanse, lot of fiber. if you do this youre asking for it)
- Veggie chili (again, a great cleanse, but you're asking for it. needs a lot of beans)
- bad pizza (me problem)
- indian food (needs to be spicy af)
- halal guys / halal food (needs to be spicy af - meat only w/ minimal veggies, just w/ salad)
- Mcdonalds

- Taco bell (VEGGIE only. taco bell is the mid-point. t bell is neutral here. get meat and it drops down to worse. )

- Italian food (primarily veggies like eggplant parm. acid from red sauces make this just above mid-point)
- Salad / chicken caesar salad
- Veggie burgers (not impossible/beyond meat)
- Falafel
- Smoothies (needs to have fruits, greens, flax and chia seeds)


If you add metamucil to any in the list it gives it a +5 boost toward a "better movement"
