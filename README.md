## Introduction

In a diverse corporate environment, it's essential to consider the dietary needs of our employees when planning events, meetings, and gatherings that involve food. This project aims to create a complicated food list that covers a wide range of dietary preferences and restrictions, including but not limited to vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, lactose-intolerant, and religious dietary requirements. By maintaining this comprehensive list, we can ensure that everyone feels included and valued during food-related events.
